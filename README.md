# operating-system-design
This repository contains programs for some algorithms I worked on, in the OS design practical in our college.
Below is the description of the file names and thier contents. All of them contain process scheduling algorithms.
1. GG_OSD1.C - First come first serve algorithm
2. GG_OSD2.C - Shortest job first algorithm
3. GG_OSDP3.C - Priority scheduling algorithm
4. GG_OSD4.C - Round robin scheduling algorithm
5. GG_OSD5.C - Simple example of fork system call
6. GG_KNAPS.C - Implementation of Knapsack problem
